\section{Theory }              
\justify A doubly-linked list is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains two fields, called links, that are references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes.\\~\\
 A Doubly Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.\\~\\

\section{Task}  
\subsection{Procedure: Task 1 Insertion at the start}

In this Doubly Linked List user can insert integer type of the data and the data will always be inserted in the start of the list.  

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]

 
void insert(node* newNode){
	node* last_node = (node*)malloc(sizeof(node));
	last_node = head;
	head = newNode;
	newNode -> pre = NULL;
	newNode -> next = last_node;
	return;
}

Output:
\end{lstlisting}
Please see Figure 1 for output

\subsection{Procedure: Task 2 Traverse}     

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++]
void display(){
	node* newNode = (node*)malloc(sizeof(node));
	newNode = head;
	cout<<"\n\nData in the list\n\n";
	while(newNode != NULL){
		cout<<newNode -> data<<" ";
		newNode = newNode -> next;
	}
	cout<<"\n\nPress any key to continue..";
	getch();
	return;
}

Output: 
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Conclusion}
A Doubly linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element is called as a node, that contains three item - the data, a reference to the previous node, and a reference to the next node. The last node has a reference to null. The entry point into a Doubly linked list is same as the simple linked list called the head of the list. A Doubly linked list is a dynamic data structure. The number of nodes in a list is not fixed and can grow and shrink on demand.\\~\\
